11) figure out how to include skeinforge (or at least SFACT)
14) SD support - print from only - no print to
18) other places for separate thread - file saving, stl file saving from plater
22) need a tool change mechanism
24) G Code Reference
25) Macros
26) Firmware Update
27) web server
28) integration with webcam
29) drive two printers simultaneously

a) after bringing a file into fileprep from plater, after it is loaded into gcf, we see the temporary
file name instead of the temporary tag

b) @ the start, the hot bed and hot end should be preloaded with the temps of the currently selected 
filament instead of PLA temperatures

c) change those print statements into LogMessages.  Add LogMessage for start slice, start gcode read, start model processing, etc
