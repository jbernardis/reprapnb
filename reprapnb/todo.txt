11) figure out how to include skeinforge (or at least SFACT)
14) SD support - print from only - no print to
18) other places for separate thread - file saving, stl file saving from plater
22) need a tool change mechanism
24) G Code Reference
25) Macros
26) Firmware Update
27) web server
28) integration with webcam
29) drive two printers simultaneously
30) add acceleration to ini file somewhere - should be in slicer config

==>a) after bringing a file into fileprep from plater, after it is loaded into gcf, we see the temporary
file name instead of the temporary tag

b) @ the start, the hot bed and hot end should be preloaded with the temps of the currently selected 
filament instead of PLA temperatures
similarly, if I change the temps inside a slicer, when I come back to the NB, and hit the refresh button
it should read that temperature so that pull from profile gets the new value

==>c) change those print statements into LogMessages.  Add LogMessage for start slice, start gcode read, start model processing, etc
