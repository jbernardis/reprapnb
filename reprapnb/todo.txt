2) Proper information from slicer: still need to figure out what to do about multiple axes
3) turn print following on/off
4) implement send gcode
9) Display additional info on monitor screen:  Z Height, Layer#/Total Layers, ETA, lines printed/total, % printed, % ahead/behind estimate, filename
11) figure out how to include skeinforge
12) fan control
13) speed control
14) SD support
15) layout of extruder and heater widgets needs to be fixed
16) previous layer in prtmon is too bright
17) filstart is always 0 - added debugging statements
18) read G code in a thread
19) widen log


BUG - print start button was enabled while printing - I think I found it - need to test
