In Progress/Need Testing
- plater hanging on large STL files
new functions for plater: center, row/column matrix multiplier
Need to test SD functionality
neaten up disconnect
need to test HTTP server




Low Hanging

Medium
- other places for separate thread - file saving from plater, amf merge, etc
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- plater hangs up on large file reads
- got confused when cancelled from-SD print

Larger effort
- integration with webcam
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc

Pie in the sky
- drive two printers simultaneously
