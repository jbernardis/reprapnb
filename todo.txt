In Progress/Need Testing
  need to test HTTP functions:
    - stop print
	- initiate slicer
	- choose slicer/slicer config
  Slicing history
  Printing history
  
in fileprep, savelayer, need to figure out how to properly handle multiple tools when doing axis resets

pendant commands
	connection to printer when multiple printers
	meta-comands (start/stop print eg)

send email when print job finishes

@runmacro
@runmacro layer=x layers=n

More capabilities from HTTP interface
	- send file to printer
	- start printer
	- activate camera
	- add to slice queue
	- slice from slice queue
	- add to print queue
	- load from print queue
	
Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- I still think there is a bug lurking in plater
