In Progress/Need Testing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print
- need to figure out why tool tips do not appear for checkboxes inside of static boxes
limit size of temperature logging files



send email when print job finishes
estimate when a later layer will start




Low Hanging
- fix closure of firmware window when clicking on text boxes

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc

Uncertain:
