In Progress/Need Testing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print
- allow override of certain slicing parameters from within host - HE temps needs testing - other fields???






Low Hanging

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc
- fix print sync to allow me to browse file without first having to uncheck - sync switched layers only if the current displayed layer is the one just being finished up
- will need a button to take us to the print position

Uncertain:
- have links inside program to bring up tools - openscad, meshlab, netfabb, etc
- look into Cura's low time estimates (traysnwalls - lip on tray is a good candidate object)
- over-ride logic - protect better against csv files being deleted


NOtes for remaining override fields:

Support on/off

Cura:
	support = None (other values?)

Slic3r:
	print: support_material = 0 (other values?)

SKF:
	raft: ????



Raft/Brim:

Cura:
	platform_adhesion = None (other values)

Slic3r:
	print: brim_width = n
	print: raft_layers = n

SKF:
	raft: Base Layers (integer):	n
	raft: Interface Layers (integer):	n
	skirt: Brim Width:	n



Infill %

Cura:
	fill_density = 40
	extrusion width?????

Slic3r:
	print: fill_density = 0.4
	print: extrusion_width = 0

SKF:
	inset: Infill Width over Thickness (ratio):	2.8
	carve: Edge Width over Height (ratio):	2.8
	fill: Infill Solidity (ratio):	0.4
