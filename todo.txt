1) when finished print to SD and try to exit, it thinks I'm still printing
2) when I choose a gcode file from the history and load it, the file name does not appear in infopane


In Progress/Need Testing
  pendant meta-comands (start/stop print eg)
  need to test HTTP functions:
    - stop print
	- initiate slicer
  connection manager - if only 1 connection and nothing is selected when reset of close is pressed, use that connection
  If more that 1 connection - give a message box (or see if there is a way to know that nothing is selected and disable buttons)

camera:
	implement camera controls - light balance, resolution, etc
	implement a time-lapse algorithm
  
in fileprep, savelayer, need to figure out how to properly handle multiple tools when doing axis resets


send email when print job finishes

@runmacro
@runmacro layer=x layers=n

More capabilities from HTTP interface
	- send file to printer
	- start printer
	- activate camera
	- add to slice queue
	- slice from slice queue
	- add to print queue
	- load from print queue
	
Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
