In Progress/Need Testing
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- web server  need to test and add additional functionality
- printer reset
- an icon for the main screen and for when minimized

Low Hanging
- G Code Reference
- add acceleration to ini file somewhere - should be in slicer config

Medium
- SD support - print from only - no print to
- other places for separate thread - file saving, stl file saving from plater
- limit size of log
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- need a tool change mechanism

Larger effort
- Firmware Update
- integration with webcam
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb

Pie in the sky
- drive two printers simultaneously
