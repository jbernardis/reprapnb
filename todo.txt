In Progress/Need Testing
- web server  need to test and add additional functionality
- an icon for the main screen and for when minimized
- need a tool change mechanism
- in general need to handle 2 or 3 extruders - temp graphs, etc

Low Hanging
- add acceleration to ini file somewhere - should be in slicer config

Medium
- SD support - print from only - no print to
- other places for separate thread - file saving
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- plater hangs up on large file reads

Larger effort
- integration with webcam
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc

Pie in the sky
- drive two printers simultaneously

Print to SD
	Initial:
		SD Printing = False

	- list SD card contents M21; M20; get responses
	- allow the user to choose file or enter a new filename or cancel
	- if cancelled exit
	- if an existing file, ask for overwrite confirmation

	- SD File = <lowercase fn>
	- display target on screen
	- enable abandon button

	- in prtmon:
		- if SD printing:
			- if print completion:
				M29 <lfn>
				SD Printing, printing = false
				SD File = None
				clear target from screen
				enable print
				disable pause

			- if pause:
				- confirm pause will terminate printing to SD
				if no exit
				M29 <lfn>
				print completion/SD print completion
				SD printing, printing = False
				enable abandon button
				enable start
				disable pause

			- if abandon:
				SD File = None
				clear target from screen
				disable abandon button

		- if start and SD File is not None:
			M28 <lfn>
			SD Printing, printing = True
			disable print button
			enable pause button

		if forwarded file:
			SD File = None
			clear target from screen
