In Progress/Need Testing
- print from SD card does not show progress
- print from SD card does not correctly end print - program still thinks it is printing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print






Low Hanging

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- got confused when cancelled from-SD print
- printmon- pause/restart -> import button was not disabled - NEED MORE INFO

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc
