In Progress/Need Testing
  need to test HTTP functions:
    - stop print
	- initiate slicer
	- choose slicer/slicer config
  Slicing history
  Printing history
  
in fileprep, savelayer, need to figure out how to properly handle multiple tools when doing axis resets

pendant commands
	retraction/extrusion
	connection to printer
	executable to interface

send email when print job finishes

@runmacro
@runmacro layer=x layers=n

More capabilities from HTTP interface
	- send file to printer
	- start printer
	- activate camera
	- add to slice queue
	- slice from slice queue
	- add to print queue
	- load from print queue
	
manual control - need a button to keep Z motor engaged
	
Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- I still think there is a bug lurking in plater
