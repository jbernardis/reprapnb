1) when finished print to SD and try to exit, it thinks I'm still printing
2) when print to SD card, infopane does not show source file




In Progress/Need Testing
  pendant meta-comands (start/stop print eg)
  need to test HTTP functions:
    - stop print
	- initiate slicer
  
in fileprep, savelayer, need to figure out how to properly handle multiple tools when doing axis resets

pendant commands
	connection to printer when multiple printers

send email when print job finishes

@runmacro
@runmacro layer=x layers=n

More capabilities from HTTP interface
	- send file to printer
	- start printer
	- activate camera
	- add to slice queue
	- slice from slice queue
	- add to print queue
	- load from print queue
	
Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- I still think there is a bug lurking in plater
