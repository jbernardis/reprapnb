1) when finished print to SD and try to exit, it thinks I'm still printing
2) when I choose a gcode file from the history and load it, the file name does not appear in infopane

test for filament diameter match needs improvement - check numeric value - not string - test multi-values and different sized lists


In Progress/Need Testing
  pendant meta-comands (start/stop print eg)
  need to test HTTP functions:
    - stop print
	- initiate slicer

camera:
	finish time-lapse algorithm - need to ask for directory and interval, need to integrate with printmon
	
in fileprep, savelayer, need to figure out how to properly handle multiple tools when doing axis resets


send email when print job finishes

@runmacro
@runmacro layer=x layers=n

More capabilities from HTTP interface
	- send file to printer
	- start printer
	- activate camera
	- add to slice queue
	- slice from slice queue
	- add to print queue
	- load from print queue
	
Need more info
