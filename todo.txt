In Progress/Need Testing
- web server  need to test and add additional functionality
- an icon for the main screen and for when minimized
- need a tool change mechanism
- in general need to handle 2 or 3 extruders - temp graphs, etc

Low Hanging
- add acceleration to ini file somewhere - should be in slicer config

Medium
- other places for separate thread - file saving
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- plater hangs up on large file reads

Larger effort
- integration with webcam
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc

Pie in the sky
- drive two printers simultaneously
