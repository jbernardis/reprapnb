In Progress/Need Testing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print
@pause layer=x lift=xmm



send email when print job finishes

add a queue of jobs to print

@runmacro
@runmacro layer=x layers=n

*****clear pending pauses when model is imported
?????check pending pause is off by 1 layer.  Pause was on layer 13, check said it was on 14
*****paused message was displayed as an error
*****exception on shutdown when toaster is destroyed



Low Hanging
- fix closure of firmware window when clicking on text boxes

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- there were some stls that loaded properly into plater but not into view - need to save one and figure out why

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc
- add the ability to add @ statements right into the g code to perform various functions during print - pronterface has a large list

Uncertain:
