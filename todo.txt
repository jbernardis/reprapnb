In Progress/Need Testing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print



send email when print job finishes

batch slicing
add a queue of jobs to print

@runmacro
@runmacro layer=x layers=n


add logic to model to keep track of pending pauses, and use this in printmon instead of asking reprap.

Low Hanging
- fix closure of firmware window when clicking on text boxes

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available
- there were some stls that loaded properly into plater but not into view - need to save one and figure out why

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc
- add the ability to add @ statements right into the g code to perform various functions during print - pronterface has a large list

Uncertain:
