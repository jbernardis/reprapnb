In Progress/Need Testing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print
- allow override of certain slicing parameters from within host - other fields???
- test override of infill and extrusion width, support
- add help slicer-dependent tooltips to override fields






Low Hanging

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc
- fix print sync to allow me to browse file without first having to uncheck - sync switched layers only if the current displayed layer is the one just being finished up
- will need a button to take us to the print position

Uncertain:
- have links inside program to bring up tools - openscad, meshlab, netfabb, etc
- look into Cura's low time estimates (traysnwalls - lip on tray is a good candidate object)


NOtes for remaining override fields:

adhesion type:
	none
		cura	None
		slic3r  brim_width=0, raft_layers=0
		skeinforge brim_width 0 (skirt.csv) base layers=0 interface layers = 0 (raft.csv)
		
	brim
		cura	brim
		slic3r	brim_width = n, raft_layers = 0
		skeinforge: brim_width = n, base layers = 0 interface layers = 0
		
	raft
		cura	raft
		slic3r	brim_width = 0, raft_layers = n
		skeinforge	nrim_width = 0, baselayers = 1, interface lyers = 2
