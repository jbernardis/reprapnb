In Progress/Need Testing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print
- show current slicing profile in plater in tooltip for "forward to slicer" button






Low Hanging

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc
