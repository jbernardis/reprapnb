In Progress/Need Testing
- need to test HTTP server - stop print
- allow override of certain slicing parameters from within host - HE temps needs testing - other fields???






Low Hanging

Medium
- meta-operations inside of macros - @pause, @sh, etc - will need the ability to insert %x% variables into macros

Need more info
- cancellation of slice - subsequent slice did not present file open dialog box
- if plater->slice fails, it leaves nb in a weird state where no buttons are available

Larger effort
- Macros - ability to add/delete/edit macros from within rrnb - layout of the macro buttons, etc
- fix print sync to allow me to browse file without first having to uncheck - sync switched layers only if the current dislayed layer is the one just being finished up

Uncertain:
- have links inside program to bring up tools - openscad, meshlab, netfabb, etc
